LETS SEE WHO READS THE README

I added a lot of stuff to the project, but didn't have a ton of time to test it. If you see something and you don't like it, just try turning it off. 

Scoreboard should work, but is completely untested (but its my code so it should work)

you should be able to have at least 2 teams in the game. Groups of up to 4 (2v2) is ideal. IDK how it would run with more players. Maybe test it at the end of class? It should support 25 but my code is... not super efficient.

Be nice to Mr Reid. 5 points to whoever sets him up with an updated version of the project. -5 points to the first person who mentions "HEY THERES FUNNY COMMENTS IN THE README"
